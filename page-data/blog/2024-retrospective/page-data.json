It all began with optimizing the response times of comprehensive workflows, where our layer contributed only a fraction of the total time.</p>\n<p>When it comes to performance optimization, it often feels like the bulk of the effort is spent identifying the bottlenecks rather than implementing the actual fixes. Additionally, persuading other teams that their component significantly impacts performance can be quite challenging.</p>\n<p>Next, I tackled designing enhancements for the <code>authorization</code> functionalities in various legacy features. This endeavor required significant effort to decipher the existing implementations. Being part of the <em>CSM platform</em>, which is extended by multiple industry teams, added layers of complexity. Even a minor oversight could lead to severe regressions and countless customer issues.</p>\n<p>Amidst this, we encountered a rare and critical customer issue—once again related to performance. This time, we had to work on a component we never developed initially, compounded by numerous integrations with external systems.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, several directives from the top leadership began pouring in, demanding heightened <code>security</code> for our applications. As the Security Champion of the entire <em>Customer and Industry Workflows</em>, I found myself spearheading numerous POCs, crafting implementation guidelines, and supporting multiple teams with their security concerns.</p>\n<p>In the last quarter, I made an internal transition to the <code>AI Agents</code> team to build a disruptive framework. In a short span, I implemented several performance improvements, developed new AI features, and assisted internal teams in adopting the framework and solving their use cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"achievements-and-accolades\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#achievements-and-accolades\" aria-label=\"achievements and accolades permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Achievements and Accolades</h2>\n<p>I was <code>promoted</code> to the next career level.</p>\n<p>I received the <code>Llama Award</code>, nominated by my manager, for my work on the critical customer issue, performance fixes, and driving security initiatives across the organization.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I was honored with the <code>Freddie Galactic Gratitude Award</code>, nominated by my peers, for assisting my teammates in their day-to-day tasks and fostering a culture of belonging within the organization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wellness-and-recreation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wellness-and-recreation\" aria-label=\"wellness and recreation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wellness and Recreation</h2>\n<p>I started using the office gym, with a few pauses due to travel and health issues. Nevertheless, I came back stronger each time. I also enjoyed playing table tennis at the office after work and indulged in badminton during the weekends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel-experiences\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#travel-experiences\" aria-label=\"travel experiences permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Travel Experiences</h2>\n<p>Our trip to <code>Kodaikanal</code> with office friends was nothing short of delightful. Our stay felt like a fairy tale, filled with joy and unforgettable memories. We visited the <em>Meenakshi Temple</em> in Madurai, where I was surprised to learn that the famous architectural marvel from our childhood books was actually just one of the four gopurams (entrance towers). I tried kari dosa and idiappam for the first time, and I absolutely loved idiappam.</p>\n<p>The trip to <code>Medak</code> marked my first journey exceeding 100 km on my new bike. The deer park was a delightful surprise and exceeded our expectations.</p>\n<p>We visited <code>Kolkata</code> twice this year—once for my grandmother’s funeral and again for the Bhaifota celebration. It was after decades that my parents got to celebrate Bhaifota with their siblings and cousins. During our visit, I also explored the renowned Botanical Gardens in Shibpur, famous for its great banyan tree. My cousin took us all to see a Bengali movie, which was an enjoyable experience. It was my first time watching a Bengali movie on the big screen, and it had been decades since my parents had done so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"financial-journey\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#financial-journey\" aria-label=\"financial journey permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Financial Journey</h2>\n<p>This year, my earnings outpaced my expenses, enabling me to continue disciplined investing.

She had been bedridden for many years. Her soft-spoken and cheerful nature will always keep her memory alive among us.</p>\n<p>We moved to a more spacious home, upgrading from a 2-BHK to a 3-BHK in the same locality. The new house features larger rooms, bigger balconies, and a dedicated parking space. We also bought our first air conditioner. Additionally, I purchased a new phone after five years, thanks to a teammate who happened to be in the US on a business trip at that time.</p>\n<p>Lastly, my wedding has been finalized, and I am thrilled to embrace this joyous milestone in the coming year.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 11, 2025","title":"2024: A Year of Growth","featuredImageAltText":"An image containing collage of various images throughout the year","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/baaed/2024_Retro.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/dd515/2024_Retro.jpg 200w,\n/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/47930/2024_Retro.jpg 400w,\n/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/baaed/2024_Retro.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/2e34e/2024_Retro.webp 200w,\n/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/416c3/2024_Retro.webp 400w,\n/static/f4c2b09d3a3167bca4ef9c6c111a24a5/c1587/2024_Retro.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":800}}}},"tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#my-professional-journey\">My Professional Journey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#achievements-and-accolades\">Achievements and Accolades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wellness-and-recreation\">Wellness and Recreation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#travel-experiences\">Travel Experiences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#financial-journey\">Financial Journey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#personal-reflections\">Personal Reflections</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2024-retrospective/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1865044719","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
